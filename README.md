## Introduction
Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) that process data. Each connection has an associated weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The network learns to minimize the error in its predictions through a process called backpropagation.

## Architecture
A typical neural network architecture includes:
1. **Input Layer**: Receives the input features.
2. **Hidden Layers**: Processes the input through weighted connections.
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final output.
